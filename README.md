Life has been fun with this machine, I will update this for a bit as i finish fixing sleep but everything else has mostly been fixed (Except USB C hotplugging, never figured out how to do so)

***My Model***:

My Model is Equipped with an I7-7600U, with HD 620 (not UHD 620) 16GB of RAM, a Toshiba NVMe drive, Intel WiFi & Bluetooth and Conexant CX8200 audio

*What works*:

Sound/Mic (not on Tahoe B2 obviously but it does work on any other version you install)

iServices (I have a really loaded appleID, this might not work for you)

USB-A Hotplugging 

HDMI

WiFi and Bluetooth (itlwm + heliport combo ftw, though BT is a bit unstable at times on tahoe, works fine on sequoia and under)

Working Battery Percentage

Wired Sidecar (dunno why it times out when trying wireless) 

Internal Periferals behave gloriously with the combination of VoodooPS2 and VoodooRMI

Camera

*What doesn't work*:

Thunderbolt 3: Won't attempt to fix, don't even own any thunderbolt accesories to try

Fingerprint reader: Not a surprise, (if only booting macOS, I would recommned you disable it in the BIOS, it'll help you save some battery life)
